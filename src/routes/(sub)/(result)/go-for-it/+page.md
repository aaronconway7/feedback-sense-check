## Fantastic, go for it!

Giving positive feedback is very important. To be as helpful as possible, be clear and specific.

### Positive feedback is important

Positive feedback is super important. It helps us know we're on the right track, and it feels good when our efforts are recognised. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/curating-your-life/202206/the-gottman-ratio-happy-relationships-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Evidence suggests we should be giving around 5 times more positive feedback than negative.</a>

### Be clear and specific

Examples help us understand what we're doing well, so we can continue. You could describe the:

<GiveFeedback />

It could be as simple as 'Very well structured presentation, with great use of visuals, easy to process [behaviour] in the weekly wrap just now [situation], really exciting to see how your work contributes to our goals! [impact] Be as specific as you can with the [behaviour] to help them really understand what they can do more of.

### Make it timely

It helps if the feedback is timely â€“ soon after the event, so it's fresh in the person's mind.
