<h1>About</h1>

<p>“Withholding feedback is choosing comfort over growth. 
  Staying silent deprives people of the opportunity to learn. 
  In healthy relationships, honesty is an expression of care.”</p>
<p>– Adam Grant, Psychologist</p>
  
 <h3>Helping develop the people we care about</h3>

<p>A healthy feedback loop builds awareness and helps people improve. We have a responsibility to develop the people we care about.
<p>But when we receive feedback, a flood of neurochemicals activated in the amygdala (where emotions are predominantly processed) </p>
  limits our abilities to activate other parts of the brain typically used for higher/executive function – reducing our ability to process / think logically. 
<p>As a result, we can make irrational choices, give feedback poorly, and break the feedback loop.</p>
<p>Feedback Sense Check is a questionnaire-style web flow to help you manage your emotions before giving – or after receiving – feedback. </p>
<p>It’s for anyone working in an organisation to build empathy, maintain a healthy feedback loop and help people develop.</p>

<h3>Biases and perspectives in feedback</h3>

<p>When we perceive, we take in sensory information and mesh it with what we know about the world, 
  which can sometimes be based on limited or exceptional information; hence biases. 
  This is why perspectives often differ - not only do we collect different sensory data from literally different perspectives 
  but we also add our own unique perspective to this process to create ‘our truth’ on what happened. </p>
  <p>This is what feedback aims to reveal. How our perspectives differ. </p>
  <p>And there is no ‘right’ way to look at something but there can be learning for both of you.</p>

<h3>Why I created Feedback Sense Check</h3>
<p>“I’ve given feedback badly, too many times. Once I gave feedback at 4pm on a Friday while I was feeling grumpy – it landed badly and caused someone I care about to feel bad over the weekend.
I came up with the idea for Feedback Sense Check in 2022 to avoid that kind of situation. It’s a logical friend to help manage emotions and give feedback in a better way.
  It started as a side project, before collaborating with Simon and others at Thriva.”</p>

<h3>Built during Thriva Maker Day</h3>
v1 of Feedback Sense Check was built in one day, 9 March 2023, by some of the amazing team at Thriva.
