<h3>As you're more senior, bear in mind your feedback has added credibility</h3>
<p>
	As you're hierarchically senior, remember that your feedback is going to have added credibility.
	It may be viewed as â€˜the opinion of the company', or coming from someone they look up to, from a
	career perspective. The individual may therefore be feeling as though your perspective affects the
	company's view of them (and possibly their performance). This may be the case, especially if
	you're the manager, so it's important to remind them that this is one observation in amongst many
	others and that your intention is curiosity and development.
