<h3 class="text-3xl mb-8">It's easier because you have a good relationship, but still lead with curiosity</h3>
<p class="text-lg mb-8">As you already have a caring, trusting relationship, chances are you may have already shared feedback with one another. That makes it so much easier to give feedback, and more chance it will land well (or be forgiven if it doesn't). However, we can sometimes avoid giving feedback if we want people to like us. Resist these urges - remind yourself and them that development leads to better outcomes for all of us - and that you hope you can both learn from having what seems to be an uncomfortable conversation.</p>
