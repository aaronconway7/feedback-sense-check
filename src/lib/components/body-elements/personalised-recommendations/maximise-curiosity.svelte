<h3 class="text-3xl mb-8">As you haven't yet built a caring, trusting relationship, maximise your curiosity</h3>
<p class="text-lg mb-8">You could start by asking if now's a good time for feedback, and how they prefer to receive it.</p>                
<p class="text-lg mb-8">Perhaps they have a ‘user manual' – something which says how they like to receive feedback, and other insights about them.</p>
<p class="text-lg mb-8">Before giving direct feedback, consider leading with a question. For example, if you have feedback about how they facilitated a workshop, consider asking – ‘How do you feel the workshop went?'. Perhaps you'll uncover something in their response which helps you give more helpful feedback.</p>                
<p class="text-lg mb-8">If you're not familiar with someone, giving feedback can often be easier - but if you're new to a team, or they're new to your team, you may avoid feedback on the basis that you need to ‘make a good impression' and build relationships. Resist these urges - remind yourself and them that development leads to better outcomes for all of us - and that you hope you can both learn from having what seems to be an uncomfortable conversation.</p>
