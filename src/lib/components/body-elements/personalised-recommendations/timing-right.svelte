<h3>The timing seems right</h3>
<p>Right now it's {time} on a {day}. Assuming your colleague works standard weekday hours, now could be a good time to give feedback. If they work different hours, consider â€“ is this a good time to feed back, or is it late in their working day / a non-working day? If so, they might not be in a great headspace to receive feedback.</p>
