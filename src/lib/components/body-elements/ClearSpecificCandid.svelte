<h3 class="text-3xl mb-8">When you're ready to give feedback, be clear, specific, and candid</h3>
<p class="text-lg mb-8">Try to describe the:</p>
<GiveFeedback/>
<p class="text-lg mb-8">It could be as simple as: 'Hey X, how are you? I wanted to share something with you and was wondering if this is a good time?'</p>
<p class="text-lg mb-8">If yes, then: 'I noticed in this [situation], your [behaviour] has had an [impact] on. I wanted to check with you and hear your perspective.'</p>
<p class="text-lg mb-8">This is called <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/closing-the-gap-between-intent-vs-impact-sbii/">the SBI model</a>. If you prefer to use a different model, like <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/a94k5vp/the-coin-conversation-model">COIN</a>, go for it.</p>
<p class="text-lg mb-8">Be candid. <a href="https://twitter.com/adammgrant/status/1395361167862808579?lang=en">In healthy relationships, honesty is an expression of care.</a></p>
<h2 class="text-6xl mb-8">Bear these things in mind too</h2>
<h3 class="text-3xl mb-8">Make it a dialogue</h3>
<p class="text-lg mb-8">Stay caring and curious, and try to make feedback a dialogue. You could ask:</p>
<ul class="mb-8 text-lg list-disc ml-4">
  <li class="mb-2">How do you feel about my feedback? or</li>
  <li class="mb-2">What's your perspective? or</li>
  <li class="mb-2">How can I help?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text-3xl mb-8">Make it timely</h3>
<p class="text-lg mb-8">It helps if the feedback is timely â€“ soon after the situation, so it's fresh in their mind.</p>
<h3 class="text-3xl mb-8">Keep it private</h3>
<p class="text-lg mb-8">Feedback is best delivered in private, not in a team setting.</p>
<h3 class="text-3xl mb-8">Can cultures collide?</h3>
<p class="text-lg mb-8">Receptiveness to the various ways that feedback is delivered can differ across personalities, lifestyles, industries, and cultures. Just look at context in cultural communication by Edward T. Hall (1959). And these are not often details that we know about the people we work with. There is no silver bullet for giving feedback. But if you follow a structure for observation (such as SBI) and are genuinely curious about understanding their perspective on things, it can be a learning experience for both of you. Be prepared to fail, be prepared to learn about them, and how you both communicate with one another.</p>
<h3 class="text-3xl mb-8">You're responsible for the delivery, not the response</h3>
<p class="text-lg mb-8">Even well delivered feedback can cause an emotional response. You're not responsible for the person's reaction. If they respond defensively, be curious and ask them what's going on for them. For guidance you could <a href="www.test.com/sense-check">restart the Feedback Sense Check</a> and click 'Someone's responded to my feedback'.</p>
<h3 class="text-3xl mb-8">Keep the feedback loop going!</h3>
<p class="text-lg mb-8">Good luck with your feedback. It's great that you're giving it, and giving it well. Keep the feedback loop healthy!</p>
